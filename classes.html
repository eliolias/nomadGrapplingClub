    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>
    While our Fundamentals class is open to all levels, the material is taught from the standpoint of someone who is completely new to Jiu Jitsu. There is a strong focus on understanding the mechanics of each technique as well as the multiple ways in which it can be expressed. Each month we focus on a different component of the art (example arm bars one month, sweeps another, etc) and the time is largely spent learning and drilling techniques. There is rarely any live matches or sparing in these classes. </p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">All Levels</h3>
    <p>
    As the name implies, these classes are in fact open to all levels – from a first day student to blackbelt. Like many Jiu Jitsu schools, this serves as the core of our training and follows a fairly standard structure: 10-15 minutes of warm ups and a warm up game, 15-20 minutes of learning and drilling technique followed by live rounds/sparring for the remainder of the time.</p> 
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Conditioning Class</h3>
    <p>
    These classes assume at least a few weeks of experience as much of the time is spent in live engagement with a partner. A brief warm-up is followed by 10-15 minutes of either hard calisthenics (as a group) or positional drilling with full resistance. The remainder of the class is spent in live round starting from compromised positions. The goal is to physically exhaust the student prior to the live rounds. By starting in compromised position and compounded by exhaustion, it forces the student to stay calm under stress and rely on their technique. </p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Mat</h3>
    <p>
    Open Mat classes are scheduled at various times through the year. After a brief warm-up, the entire time is spent in live rounds/sparring. This is a great opportunity for students to both pressure test their game and refine their capabilities with skilled resistance. Not a great ‘first class’ but otherwise, these sessions are open to all levels. </p>
